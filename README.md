### Hello!

I am a 2023 App Academy graduate. I took their bootcamp prep course, then their Software Engineering course. At App Academy, I learned JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, SQL, and more skills for both frontend and backend software development.

I've enjoyed all my programming work and now am seeking work in software engineering. I am constantly learning and developing my skills. I enjoy problem solving and learning about this rapidly evolving field.

Before programming, I graduated with a BA in Economics in 2018 from the University of Chicago. Then I worked as a chess teacher for Success Academy Charter Schools. While there, I coached the 1st place 2022 National Elementary School Chess Championships (K-6 U1000) team, 2nd place 2019 National Grade Level Chess Championships team (5th grade), 1st place New York State Elementary Chess Championships (K-6 U1000) team, and had many other fantastic results both nationally and locally.
